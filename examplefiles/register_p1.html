It is recommended that treatment is started with abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine separately for the first 6-8 weeks (see section 4.4). The choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, but mainly on expected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues. <br/><br/>The demonstration of the benefit of Trizivir is mainly based on results of studies performed in treatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease. In patients with high viral load (>100,000 copies/mL) choice of therapy needs special consideration (see section 5.1). <br/><br/>Overall, the virologic suppression with this triple nucleoside regimen could be inferior to that obtained with other multitherapies notably including boosted Protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, therefore the use of Trizivir should only be considered under special circumstances (e.g. co-infection with tuberculosis).<br/><br/>Before initiating treatment with abacavir, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be performed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin(see section 4.4). Abacavir should not be used in patients known to carry the HLA-B*5701 allele.","company":"ViiV Healthcare BV"},
